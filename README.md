# Walmart Global Tech 

- Walmart used to hire only on-campus, but this time, they had a hiring competition named Walmart CodeHers in July. I learned about this opportunity from a telegram Channel, so I decided to apply for it. I applied on the D2C platform.
They had 2 O.A. rounds for the process: The first one had 25 MCQ questions to be solved in 30 minutes and the second one consisted of 2 D.S.A. coding questions revolving upon strings and dynamic programming.
Every round was an elimination round.

- I cleared both rounds and was informed interviews would take place later this year.

- I had ample time, so I started practicing more and more questions. Interview experiences on GeeksForGeeks and YouTube helped a lot to provide a clear picture of the type of questions being asked.
We were asked if we would be interested in a 6-month internship with Walmart Global Tech in September. After confirming the same, in October, I received an interview invite. It was a one-day interview process: back-to-back interviews on the same day.

- Interview Process:
Mode of Interview: Zoom
- Round 1 (Technical round):
The interview started with me introducing myself. In the introduction. I briefly explained myself, the domain I am interested in, the internships I did, my projects, and my hobbies. The interviewer was very friendly, and she made me very comfortable. The interview started with questions on OOPS, followed by questions based on D.S.A. (Dynamic Programming and Trees). She asked me to code a coding question in my editor. The question level was medium-hard. After that, she started asking questions from DBMS and O.S. to check my knowledge about C.S. fundamentals. The interview lasted for an hour. And after 2â€“3 hours, I got the interview mail for Round 2.

- Round 2 (Hiring Manager Round):
It involved a few technical questions and questions from my project. She asked me to explain the whole back-end part of my project, followed by some leadership questions. She was very much impressed by my confidence and enthusiasm. This round lasted around 15 minutes only.
After 3 hours, I received the selection mail stating that they would like to offer me a 6-month internship. In times like the global pandemic when many people around the globe were losing their jobs, securing an internship from a Fortune-1 company was no less than a miracle.
