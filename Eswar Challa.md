The process was very simple that TCS will conduct NQT test having aptitude, Verbal, Advanced Quantitative aptitude and Simple code, Advanced Code.
Based on the score they segrerate into different kind of roles such as Ninja, Digital, Prime.
The Interveiw process as follows:
  There is MR+TR at one panel. They would majorly focus on technical and some managerial questions. Majorly questions related to Resume, Project, Emerging Technologies. We need to write the code that they ask in Digital role. They asks SQL, Programming Questions, and some other core subject questions for CSE.
  If you fail to answer them properly then they won't proceed your application to HR. It means you could not attend HR round. You are rejected at that stage itself. 
  If you proceed to HR round then they focues on what you know about organization, Family background, Shifts, Location and other related questions.
The whole interview process could take around 30-40 min approximately.(if you attend the HR round as well).
